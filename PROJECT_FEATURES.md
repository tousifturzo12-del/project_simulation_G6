## F-1: Implement User Registration Page
The registration feature allows new users to create an account on the platform. During this process, users are required to provide their full name, a valid email address, and a phone number to ensure proper identification. They must also set a secure password and confirm it to avoid any mistakes. Once the registration form is submitted, the system sends a One-Time Password (OTP) to the user via email or SMS. The user must then enter this OTP to verify their identity and complete the registration process successfully. This ensures that only legitimate users can access the platform, maintaining both security and data integrity.
**Status: Implemented**
